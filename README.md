# How to use the "developer relations anywhere" template

This is a adaptable template to build [draft developer relations plans](template.md) when starting or restarting developer relations programs.

One way to use this template is to organize your understanding of an organization's needs during the interview process. You can remove what's not relevant to their goals, add your hunches and analysis as they develop.

This template can then translate well in developing your plans over the next several months and years as your developer ecosystem matures.

I've been extraordinarily lucky to work in the early days of technical evangelism, developer relations, and platform management at a number of companies and this template represents my approach to tackling _developer relations anywhere_.

---

## How to use this

This [draft developer plan](template.md) is a template meant to be cloned for your own organization. 

The draft references abstract _platform product_ and treats _developers_ as a very broad category. 

In reality, your product is more specific and you likely have a subset of the entire developer market in mind. _Bring your own platform facts, foibles, and fun._

This template is most effective for growth-minded developer relations teams operating directly with product and engineering. Suggested local metrics are mostly placeholders, meant to be replaced with the kinds of metrics you care about.

Customize the template as you learn about your company, its platform, and its developers. Find the approach that will serve them best by removing irrelevant subteams or adding new ones.

**Suggestions or improvements welcome**. This belongs to all of us!

## Customization suggestions

### Team structure

If your team is just starting out and it's only you, use this section to help guide and divide the work your team of one has to accomplish. Maybe you don't have partners yet and don't need to help them hands-on. Maybe your company is already setup to serve developers well with their own documentation or tools team.

All these categories are your responsibility in developer relations whether another team owns the work product around them or not. As you identify your weak spots and how you could better serve your unique developer audience, begin hiring those who can make a major impact in one or more of these specializations.

### Metrics

_Local_ metrics are within direct influence of the developer relations team, like pageviews, time on page, developer experience survey results, activation rates, feature adoption and breadth, even measurements like `XX% of developer relations team agree` on a path forward.

## Activation

You want as many developers or visitors to reach an ah-ha moment that convinces them your solution is the right one, provided it is.

From that point forward, every piece of friction in their experience can stop them from successfully accomplishing their goal.

Reducing friction reduces time to business logic. The joy in programming is there, in the business logic.

Build a _friction log_ however you see fit, as a collection of observations (& occasional suggestions) on friction encountered through a developer experience.

Think of it like a journal kept while walking through your platform's metaphorical park. Useful in early stages of joining a developer relations team to introduce an outside perspective. In later stages of team membership, to continue the metaphor, it's important to pick up the easy trash as you go. No use hoarding maps of all the litter in the park.

## Thanks to

Thank you to the one who helped with my first Perl ah-ha moment, it's guided the way since. Thank you for the tips, tricks, traps, trouble, and trust Brandon, Jim, Adam, Ryan, Amir, and Bear. Teams are where the dream becomes reality and the teams I work with teach me what's possible and probably at every turn. Thanks to LinkedIn, (the original) Twitter, Clever, and Slack for letting me stumble through devrel origin stories. And thank you to the partners in crime I depend on all the time.
