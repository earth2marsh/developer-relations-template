# Developer relations anywhere

Use this [adaptable draft plan](template.md) when starting or restarting developer relations programs.

The author recognizes these plans bias toward platform-oriented companies offering APIs and developer tools. I am used to a developer relations being a mix of advocacy, support, engineering, product management, and developer marketing. Through thick and thin, developer relations ends up responsible for everything necessary to take care of developer

## How to use this

This [draft developer plan](template.md) is meant to be a template cloned for your own organization. 

The draft references abstract _platform product_ and treats _developers_ as a very broad category. 

In reality, your product is more specific and you likely have a subset of the entire developer market in mind. _Bring your own platform problems._

This template is most effective for growth-minded developer relations teams operating directly with product and engineering. There are _XX%_ and similar placeholder goals and metrics for rather generic inspiration.

**Suggestions or improvements welcome**. This belongs to all of us!

## Definitions

* _friction log_ - a collection of observations (& occasional suggestions) on friction encountered through a developer experience. Think of it like a journal of walking through your platform's metaphorical park. Useful in early stages of joining a developer relations team to introduce an outside perspective. In later stages of team membership, to continue the metaphor, it's important to pick up the easy trash as you go. No use hoarding maps of all the litter in the park.
* _local metrics_ - metrics within direct influence of the developer relations team, like pageviews, time on page, developer experience survey results, activation rates, feature adoption and breadth, even `XX% of developer relations team agree`
