# How to use the "developer relations anywhere" template

Use this [adaptable draft plan](template.md) when starting or restarting developer relations programs.

It may be useful during an interview process. It can guide you once you have the job. It's here for you if you're working to reset a team. Maybe you're just curious what @episod thinks developer relations _is_ some years into doing it.

Infinite thanks to the world's developers first and foremost. You are why we are here. Thank you to everyone in developer relations, product, engineering, and marketing I've learned from over the years. DevRel holds all the functions within if you let it. If you want it. If you live it.

## How to use this

This [draft developer plan](template.md) is a template meant to be cloned for your own organization. 

The draft references abstract _platform product_ and treats _developers_ as a very broad category. 

In reality, your product is more specific and you likely have a subset of the entire developer market in mind. _Bring your own platform facts, foibles, and fun._

This template is most effective for growth-minded developer relations teams operating directly with product and engineering. Suggested local metrics are mostly placeholders, meant to be replaced with the kinds of metrics you care about.

Customize the template as you learn about your company, its platform, and its developers. Find the approach that will serve them best by removing irrelevant subteams or adding new ones.

**Suggestions or improvements welcome**. This belongs to all of us!

## Definitions

* _friction log_ - a collection of observations (& occasional suggestions) on friction encountered through a developer experience. Think of it like a journal of walking through your platform's metaphorical park. Useful in early stages of joining a developer relations team to introduce an outside perspective. In later stages of team membership, to continue the metaphor, it's important to pick up the easy trash as you go. No use hoarding maps of all the litter in the park.
* _local metrics_ - metrics within direct influence of the developer relations team, like pageviews, time on page, developer experience survey results, activation rates, feature adoption and breadth, even `XX% of developer relations team agree`
